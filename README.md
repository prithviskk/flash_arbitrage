## Arbitrage
Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset or financial instrument in different markets to exploit price discrepancies, thereby generating a risk-free profit. It relies on the principle that identical or equivalent assets should have the same price across markets; when this condition fails, arbitrage opportunities arise. Arbitrage helps to ensure price efficiency across markets by aligning prices through trading activities.
